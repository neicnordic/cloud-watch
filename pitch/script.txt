# Problem

We have a lot of virtual machines running in different clouds, and honestly do
you remember the server you span up on a slow friday afternoon to try to
figure out how this logstash thing that everyone was talking about years ago
works.


# Stats

Here is some statistics,

 - 1/3 of all machines in clouds sit comatose
 - 1 cpu running for one year is the equivalent burning 400 liters of petrol


# Manual Checking

Manual checking is a pain


# Solution

Our solution to this is to develop a tool that can show us all the machines we
have running in different clouds.

Developed in a client-server model to enable several different frontends such
as web, cli and so forth.


# Demo

This is the demo of the webui. Here you can see the different types of
resources that you can query.

Tenants and VMs are the two toplevel entities to get information about.

Here is the list of tenants, you can see the region, and how much resources
you have booked.


And over here, we can see a list of all running vms, when they were created
their name and how much resouces they have booked. And here we can see that
johan-test has been running for 3 months.


# Impact

With this we hope to be able to both save some trees and time for geeks like us.
